        <p>
          A designer of more than 10 years, I am a recent JavaScript bootcamp
          graduate. I admire &amp; practice simple, elegant UI design, and
          appreciate &amp; craft eloquent code that brings functional life to
          the creation of beautiful, workable interfaces that are a pleasure to
          use.
