                  Lemony Design's long-standing client, short-story advocate and
                  jewellery afficionado Joanna Sterling, sought a recent
                  redesign of her website The Casket, a well-respected platform
                  for short stories, flash fiction â€“ as well as being a display
                  case for her magnificent collection of contemporary and period
                  brooches. Somehow this all works together rather well!
                </p>
              </div>
              <aside className="project__image">
                <ZoomImage
                  imageWidth={200}
                  imageHeight={200}
                  src="../../static/example-sketch.jpg"
                />
              </aside>
            </div>

            <section className="project__design">
              <h3 className="project__subhead-design">Design</h3>

              <p>
                The redesign also involved a re-configuration of the UX, with an
                integrated filtering system for her ever-expanding stable of
                fiction, providing a solid foundation as an online publisher of
                quality short stories, making them accessible for readers who
                can now refine by type (flash, story or audio), mood, collection
                and author.

                The platform also brings to the fore her fine collection of
                studio-recorded audio stories which are pushed to podcast
                platforms upon publication.
