                <p>
                  I have worked with short-story publisher and jewellery
                  collector Joanna Sterling, a long-standing client, since 2012.
                  In 2016 Joanna sought a redesign of her website The Casket, a
                  digital publishing and podcast platform for quality short
                  stories and flash fiction â€“ as well as being a display case
                  for her magnificent collection of contemporary and period
                  brooches (somehow this works harmoniously!). In 2017 Joanna
                  decided to launch a competition, running again in 2018 and
                  becoming well-respected on the creative writing scene. Her
                  podcast, published from the site to iTunes, Sticher, TuneIn
                  and SoundCloud, has gained a large following and is 5-star
                  rated.

              <p>
                The Casket of Fictional Delights began as a micro-publishing
                venture for Joanna and fellow writers in the South of London. It
                has grown over the years and in 2016 &ndash; following the huge
                success of her TubeFlash project &ndash; she decided it was due
                for modernisation.
              </p>

              <p>
                The user interface aims at making short stories and flash
                fiction accessible and eminently browseable via:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  A visual, colour-coded card filtering system for an expanding
                  stable of fiction, making stories accessible for readers to
                  refine by type (flash, story or audio), mood, collection and
                  author.
                </li>
                <li>Generous-size typography and readability testing</li>
                <li>
                  Clear, appealing calls to action&hellip; <em>to read</em>
                  ,&nbsp;<em>view</em> and <em>listen</em>.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <p>
                The home page is designed as smorgasbord to get visitors
                exploring, featuring the latest story, brooch of the month,
                news, projects, and drawing attention to The Casket's audio USP.
              </p>
              <p>
                There is also a display-case view for Joanna's brooch
                collection, which allows users to filter the collection visually
                (by period or designer) and then access post content for each
                brooch.
              </p>
              <h3>Flash Fiction Competitions</h3>
              <p>
                2017 saw the inaugural Competition launch &ndash; and the
                creation of a new website section, with user-journey mapped from
                promo and paid submissions through to the judging announcements
                and scheduled output of winning stories published on the site
                and as podcasts. I decided to front the competition with a
                striking cover image &ndash; also used on social media in
                different guises &ndash; built around a call to action to the
                competition portal (or onscroll to the home page).
              </p>
            </section>
            <section className="project__code">
              <h3 className="project__subhead-code">Code</h3>
              <p>
                The Wordpress CMS is set up with two custom posts, stories and
                brooches, which each have a system of taxonomies and custom meta
                fields that work to provide criteria for filtering and search.
                The site uses some key plugins to drive functionality:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  I chose pro-plugin FacetWP to establish advanced ajax-based
                  filtering to cross-reference taxonomies and custom posts
                  (poems and brooches).
                </li>
                <li>
                  The platform also brings to the fore Joanna's fine collection
                  of studio-recorded audio stories which are pushed to podcast
                  platforms upon publication with Blubrry PowerPress.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Ssocial media is automated via Wordpress-to-Buffer plugin, set
                  up to post new story titles and news headlines.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Competitions integrate a PayPal payment sytem, using the
                  powerful Formidable Forms plugin suite for entries,
                  validations and submissions admin. The system uses contextual
                  logic for discounting depending on entry volume.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h3>The admin back end</h3>
              <p>
                Joanna likes to take control of the content where she can, and a
                bulk of the custom coding drives and manipulates the admin area
                and post screens to make drawing in all the required elements
                pertaining to each post as straightforward as possible.
