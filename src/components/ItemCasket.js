            <p>
              Lemony Design's long-standing client, short-story advocate and
              jewellery afficionado Joanna Sterling, sought a recent redesign of
              her website The Casket, a well-respected platform for short
              stories, flash fiction â€“ as well as being a display case for her
              magnificent collection of contemporary and period brooches.
              Somehow this all works together rather well!
            </p>

            <p>
              The redesign also involved a re-configuration of the UX, with an
              integrated filtering system for her ever-expanding stable of
              fiction, providing a solid foundation as an online publisher of
              quality short stories, making them accessible for readers who can
              now refine by type (flash, story or audio), mood, collection and
              author.
            </p>

            <p>
              The platform also brings to the fore her fine collection of
              studio-recorded audio stories which are pushed to podcast
              platforms upon publication.
            </p>
          </section>
        </main>
      </React.Fragment>
    );
  }
}

export default ItemCasket;
